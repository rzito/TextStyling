<h1>An Enigmatic Masterpiece: <i>Chopin’s Second Piano Sonata</i></h1>

<p>Frédéric Chopin (1810-49) was one of the few composers in history who wrote almost exclusively for a single instrument, the piano, and the vast majority of his works were in single-movement forms. One of only four sonatas by Chopin – three for piano and one for cello – the <i>Piano Sonata No. 2 in B-flat minor, op. 35</i> (<i>Marche funèbre</i>) is an enormously complex and enigmatic work. Its subtitle is taken from the sonata’s third movement, the iconic funeral march that came to exemplify the genre. The sonata was written in summer 1839 when Chopin was staying with his lover <a class="glossary" href="glossary.GeorgeSand">George Sand</a> at her country house in Nohant, France.</p>

<p>Although audiences immediately recognized it as a masterwork, some of Chopin’s contemporaries were not sure what to make of the piece when they first heard it. Composer and critic Robert Schumann, for example, famously asserted that it didn’t merit the title of sonata as Chopin had simply “bound together four of his most unruly children.” Giving Schumann the benefit of the doubt, this rather harsh assessment may have been influenced by his knowledge that Chopin had in fact composed the third movement two years prior to the rest of the sonata. Later commentators came to the opposite conclusion, identifying melodic and rhythmic motives that seem to bind the four movements quite tightly.</p>

<p>One of the sonata’s unusual features is its reversal in the usual ordering of the two middle movements, which normally would have been a slow second movement followed by a scherzo. In adopting this structure, Chopin may well have been deliberately emulating Beethoven’s <i>Piano Sonata No. 12 in A-flat major, op. 26</i>, which also features a scherzo as the second movement and a funeral march with trio for the third; evidently Chopin’s favorite, he played and assigned to his students more often than any other of Beethoven’s sonatas.</p>

<p>In contrast to his friend Franz Liszt, Chopin did not compose “programmatic” music that sought to depict specific stories or events, but the B-flat minor sonata has often been interpreted in a quasi-programmatic way – and not just because it contains a funeral march. The opening of the first movement itself displays such a ferocious intensity that, as Veda Kaplinsky observes, “it grabs you by the throat and doesn’t let go.” Looking at the arc of the sonata from first to final movement, she sees the first movement as representing the struggle of life; the second as the struggle of death; the third as the actual funeral; and the fourth as hell. (For pianist Anton Rubinstein, one of the most acclaimed interpreters of Chopin’s music, the last movement evoked “winds of night sweeping over churchyard graves.”)</p>

<p>While the first movement of the work is in <a class="glossary" href="glossary.SonataForm2">sonata form</a>, one notable departure from the prototype is that Chopin omitted the first theme from the recapitulation. In an intriguing analysis of the movement, theorist Anatole Leikin extends what he admits is an outmoded literary analogy that describes Classical period sonata forms as a separation and eventual reunification of the forceful first theme “hero” and more lyrical second theme “heroine.” In the B-flat minor sonata, he proposes, “the hero and the heroine cannot be united because the hero dies – and a funeral march ensues.” This is in keeping with a Romantic aesthetic disinclined to happy endings. As Leiken points out, Chopin’s procedure in this movement also contrasts with other of his recapitulations in which the first and second themes remain tonally separated but neither disappears.</p>

<p><z name="video1" align="right" />There is a much-debated question with major implications for the performer regarding the first movement: where should the double bar line indicating the repeat of the exposition occur? The eminent musicologist Charles Rosen believed the repeat should be taken at the very beginning, because the four-bar <a class="glossary" href="glossary.grave">grave</a> passage has “a double function – a dramatic beginning, and a transition from the end of the exposition back to the tonic.” He also argues that the transition makes more sense harmonically this way. Leikin, however, contends that the grave is too dramatic for a literal repetition, and that the deceptive cadence brought about by a repeat at m. 5 brings the listener back to the home key more easily. A third and perfectly valid option, one to which many pianists resort, is simply not to repeat the exposition.</p>


<p>The process of completing the sonata was evidently not easy for Chopin. Recounting his method of composing during the time he was working it, George Sand wrote:</p>

<blockquote>His creation was spontaneous, miraculous. He found ideas without looking for them, without foreseeing them. They came to his piano, sudden, complete, sublime – or sang in his head while he was taking a walk, and he had to hurry and throw himself at the instrument to make himself hear them. But then began a labour more heartbreaking than I have ever seen… He shut himself up in his room for whole days, weeping, walking about, breaking his pens, repeating or altering a measure a hundred times, writing it down and erasing it as often, and starting over the next day with a scrupulous and desperate perseverance. He would spend six weeks on one page, only to return to it and write it just as he had on the first draft …</blockquote>

<p>Chopin also found it difficult to perform. The one time he attempted to play the work for an audience, he had to take a break because of the disturbing “apparitions” he experienced (he had also suffered from nightmarish visions in the past, when he was delirious from illness). It may never have had such an effect on other pianists, but due to its extraordinary technical and interpretive demands, the op. 35 sonata has never been for the faint of heart.</p>

The sonata was written in summer 1839 when Chopin was staying with his lover <a class="glossary" href="glossary.GeorgeSand">George Sand</a> at her country house in Nohant, France.</p>

<p>Although audiences immediately recognized it as a masterwork, some of Chopin’s contemporaries were not sure what to make of the piece when they first heard it. Composer and critic Robert Schumann, for example, famously asserted that it didn’t merit the title of sonata as Chopin had simply “bound together four of his most unruly children.” Giving Schumann the benefit of the doubt, this rather harsh assessment may have been influenced by his knowledge that Chopin had in fact composed the third movement two years prior to the rest of the sonata. Later commentators came to the opposite conclusion, identifying melodic and rhythmic motives that seem to bind the four movements quite tightly.</p>

<p>One of the sonata’s unusual features is its reversal in the usual ordering of the two middle movements, which normally would have been a slow second movement followed by a scherzo. In adopting this structure, Chopin may well have been deliberately emulating Beethoven’s <i>Piano Sonata No. 12 in A-flat major, op. 26</i>, which also features a scherzo as the second movement and a funeral march with trio for the third; evidently Chopin’s favorite, he played and assigned to his students more often than any other of Beethoven’s sonatas.</p>

<p>In contrast to his friend Franz Liszt, Chopin did not compose “programmatic” music that sought to depict specific stories or events, but the B-flat minor sonata has often been interpreted in a quasi-programmatic way – and not just because it contains a funeral march. The opening of the first movement itself displays such a ferocious intensity that, as Veda Kaplinsky observes, “it grabs you by the throat and doesn’t let go.” Looking at the arc of the sonata from first to final movement, she sees the first movement as representing the struggle of life; the second as the struggle of death; the third as the actual funeral; and the fourth as hell. (For pianist Anton Rubinstein, one of the most acclaimed interpreters of Chopin’s music, the last movement evoked “winds of night sweeping over churchyard graves.”)</p>

<p>While the first movement of the work is in <a class="glossary" href="glossary.SonataForm2">sonata form</a>, one notable departure from the prototype is that Chopin omitted the first theme from the recapitulation. In an intriguing analysis of the movement, theorist Anatole Leikin extends what he admits is an outmoded literary analogy that describes Classical period sonata forms as a separation and eventual reunification of the forceful first theme “hero” and more lyrical second theme “heroine.” In the B-flat minor sonata, he proposes, “the hero and the heroine cannot be united because the hero dies – and a funeral march ensues.” This is in keeping with a Romantic aesthetic disinclined to happy endings. As Leiken points out, Chopin’s procedure in this movement also contrasts with other of his recapitulations in which the first and second themes remain tonally separated but neither disappears.</p>

<p><z name="video1" align="right" />There is a much-debated question with major implications for the performer regarding the first movement: where should the double bar line indicating the repeat of the exposition occur? The eminent musicologist Charles Rosen believed the repeat should be taken at the very beginning, because the four-bar <a class="glossary" href="glossary.grave">grave</a> passage has “a double function – a dramatic beginning, and a transition from the end of the exposition back to the tonic.” He also argues that the transition makes more sense harmonically this way. Leikin, however, contends that the grave is too dramatic for a literal repetition, and that the deceptive cadence brought about by a repeat at m. 5 brings the listener back to the home key more easily. A third and perfectly valid option, one to which many pianists resort, is simply not to repeat the exposition.</p>


<p>The process of completing the sonata was evidently not easy for Chopin. Recounting his method of composing during the time he was working it, George Sand wrote:</p>

<blockquote>His creation was spontaneous, miraculous. He found ideas without looking for them, without foreseeing them. They came to his piano, sudden, complete, sublime – or sang in his head while he was taking a walk, and he had to hurry and throw himself at the instrument to make himself hear them. But then began a labour more heartbreaking than I have ever seen… He shut himself up in his room for whole days, weeping, walking about, breaking his pens, repeating or altering a measure a hundred times, writing it down and erasing it as often, and starting over the next day with a scrupulous and desperate perseverance. He would spend six weeks on one page, only to return to it and write it just as he had on the first draft …</blockquote>

<p>Chopin also found it difficult to perform. The one time he attempted to play the work for an audience, he had to take a break because of the disturbing “apparitions” he experienced (he had also suffered from nightmarish visions in the past, when he was delirious from illness). It may never have had such an effect on other pianists, but due to its extraordinary technical and interpretive demands, the op. 35 sonata has never been for the faint of heart.</p>

<p>Frédéric Chopin (1810-49) was one of the few composers in history who wrote almost exclusively for a single instrument, the piano, and the vast majority of his works were in single-movement forms.

<p>Although audiences immediately recognized it as a masterwork, some of Chopin’s contemporaries were not sure what to make of the piece when they first heard it. Composer and critic Robert Schumann, for example, famously asserted that it didn’t merit the title of sonata as Chopin had simply “bound together four of his most unruly children.” Giving Schumann the benefit of the doubt, this rather harsh assessment may have been influenced by his knowledge that Chopin had in fact composed the third movement two years prior to the rest of the sonata. Later commentators came to the opposite conclusion, identifying melodic and rhythmic motives that seem to bind the four movements quite tightly.</p>

<p>One of the sonata’s unusual features is its reversal in the usual ordering of the two middle movements, which normally would have been a slow second movement followed by a scherzo. In adopting this structure, Chopin may well have been deliberately emulating Beethoven’s <i>Piano Sonata No. 12 in A-flat major, op. 26</i>, which also features a scherzo as the second movement and a funeral march with trio for the third; evidently Chopin’s favorite, he played and assigned to his students more often than any other of Beethoven’s sonatas.</p>

<p>In contrast to his friend Franz Liszt, Chopin did not compose “programmatic” music that sought to depict specific stories or events, but the B-flat minor sonata has often been interpreted in a quasi-programmatic way – and not just because it contains a funeral march. The opening of the first movement itself displays such a ferocious intensity that, as Veda Kaplinsky observes, “it grabs you by the throat and doesn’t let go.” Looking at the arc of the sonata from first to final movement, she sees the first movement as representing the struggle of life; the second as the struggle of death; the third as the actual funeral; and the fourth as hell. (For pianist Anton Rubinstein, one of the most acclaimed interpreters of Chopin’s music, the last movement evoked “winds of night sweeping over churchyard graves.”)</p>

<p>While the first movement of the work is in <a class="glossary" href="glossary.SonataForm2">sonata form</a>, one notable departure from the prototype is that Chopin omitted the first theme from the recapitulation. In an intriguing analysis of the movement, theorist Anatole Leikin extends what he admits is an outmoded literary analogy that describes Classical period sonata forms as a separation and eventual reunification of the forceful first theme “hero” and more lyrical second theme “heroine.” In the B-flat minor sonata, he proposes, “the hero and the heroine cannot be united because the hero dies – and a funeral march ensues.” This is in keeping with a Romantic aesthetic disinclined to happy endings. As Leiken points out, Chopin’s procedure in this movement also contrasts with other of his recapitulations in which the first and second themes remain tonally separated but neither disappears.</p>

<p><z name="video1" align="right" />There is a much-debated question with major implications for the performer regarding the first movement: where should the double bar line indicating the repeat of the exposition occur? The eminent musicologist Charles Rosen believed the repeat should be taken at the very beginning, because the four-bar <a class="glossary" href="glossary.grave">grave</a> passage has “a double function – a dramatic beginning, and a transition from the end of the exposition back to the tonic.” He also argues that the transition makes more sense harmonically this way. Leikin, however, contends that the grave is too dramatic for a literal repetition, and that the deceptive cadence brought about by a repeat at m. 5 brings the listener back to the home key more easily. A third and perfectly valid option, one to which many pianists resort, is simply not to repeat the exposition.</p>


<p>The process of completing the sonata was evidently not easy for Chopin. Recounting his method of composing during the time he was working it, George Sand wrote:</p>

<blockquote>His creation was spontaneous, miraculous. He found ideas without looking for them, without foreseeing them. They came to his piano, sudden, complete, sublime – or sang in his head while he was taking a walk, and he had to hurry and throw himself at the instrument to make himself hear them. But then began a labour more heartbreaking than I have ever seen… He shut himself up in his room for whole days, weeping, walking about, breaking his pens, repeating or altering a measure a hundred times, writing it down and erasing it as often, and starting over the next day with a scrupulous and desperate perseverance. He would spend six weeks on one page, only to return to it and write it just as he had on the first draft …</blockquote>

<p>Chopin also found it difficult to perform. The one time he attempted to play the work for an audience, he had to take a break because of the disturbing “apparitions” he experienced (he had also suffered from nightmarish visions in the past, when he was delirious from illness). It may never have had such an effect on other pianists, but due to its extraordinary technical and interpretive demands, the op. 35 sonata has never been for the faint of heart.</p>

<p>Frédéric Chopin (1810-49) was one of the few composers in history who wrote almost exclusively for a single instrument, the piano, and the vast majority of his works were in single-movement forms. One of only four sonatas by Chopin – three for piano and one for cello – the <i>Piano Sonata No. 2 in B-flat minor, op. 35</i> (<i>Marche funèbre</i>) is an enormously complex and enigmatic work.

Composer and critic Robert Schumann, for example, famously asserted that it didn’t merit the title of sonata as Chopin had simply “bound together four of his most unruly children.” Giving Schumann the benefit of the doubt, this rather harsh assessment may have been influenced by his knowledge that Chopin had in fact composed the third movement two years prior to the rest of the sonata. Later commentators came to the opposite conclusion, identifying melodic and rhythmic motives that seem to bind the four movements quite tightly.</p>

<p>One of the sonata’s unusual features is its reversal in the usual ordering of the two middle movements, which normally would have been a slow second movement followed by a scherzo. In adopting this structure, Chopin may well have been deliberately emulating Beethoven’s <i>Piano Sonata No. 12 in A-flat major, op. 26</i>, which also features a scherzo as the second movement and a funeral march with trio for the third; evidently Chopin’s favorite, he played and assigned to his students more often than any other of Beethoven’s sonatas.</p>

<p>In contrast to his friend Franz Liszt, Chopin did not compose “programmatic” music that sought to depict specific stories or events, but the B-flat minor sonata has often been interpreted in a quasi-programmatic way – and not just because it contains a funeral march. The opening of the first movement itself displays such a ferocious intensity that, as Veda Kaplinsky observes, “it grabs you by the throat and doesn’t let go.” Looking at the arc of the sonata from first to final movement, she sees the first movement as representing the struggle of life; the second as the struggle of death; the third as the actual funeral; and the fourth as hell. (For pianist Anton Rubinstein, one of the most acclaimed interpreters of Chopin’s music, the last movement evoked “winds of night sweeping over churchyard graves.”)</p>

<p>While the first movement of the work is in <a class="glossary" href="glossary.SonataForm2">sonata form</a>, one notable departure from the prototype is that Chopin omitted the first theme from the recapitulation. In an intriguing analysis of the movement, theorist Anatole Leikin extends what he admits is an outmoded literary analogy that describes Classical period sonata forms as a separation and eventual reunification of the forceful first theme “hero” and more lyrical second theme “heroine.” In the B-flat minor sonata, he proposes, “the hero and the heroine cannot be united because the hero dies – and a funeral march ensues.” This is in keeping with a Romantic aesthetic disinclined to happy endings. As Leiken points out, Chopin’s procedure in this movement also contrasts with other of his recapitulations in which the first and second themes remain tonally separated but neither disappears.</p>

<p><z name="video1" align="right" />There is a much-debated question with major implications for the performer regarding the first movement: where should the double bar line indicating the repeat of the exposition occur? The eminent musicologist Charles Rosen believed the repeat should be taken at the very beginning, because the four-bar <a class="glossary" href="glossary.grave">grave</a> passage has “a double function – a dramatic beginning, and a transition from the end of the exposition back to the tonic.” He also argues that the transition makes more sense harmonically this way. Leikin, however, contends that the grave is too dramatic for a literal repetition, and that the deceptive cadence brought about by a repeat at m. 5 brings the listener back to the home key more easily. A third and perfectly valid option, one to which many pianists resort, is simply not to repeat the exposition.</p>


<p>The process of completing the sonata was evidently not easy for Chopin. Recounting his method of composing during the time he was working it, George Sand wrote:</p>

<blockquote>His creation was spontaneous, miraculous. He found ideas without looking for them, without foreseeing them. They came to his piano, sudden, complete, sublime – or sang in his head while he was taking a walk, and he had to hurry and throw himself at the instrument to make himself hear them. But then began a labour more heartbreaking than I have ever seen… He shut himself up in his room for whole days, weeping, walking about, breaking his pens, repeating or altering a measure a hundred times, writing it down and erasing it as often, and starting over the next day with a scrupulous and desperate perseverance. He would spend six weeks on one page, only to return to it and write it just as he had on the first draft …</blockquote>

<p>Chopin also found it difficult to perform. The one time he attempted to play the work for an audience, he had to take a break because of the disturbing “apparitions” he experienced (he had also suffered from nightmarish visions in the past, when he was delirious from illness). It may never have had such an effect on other pianists, but due to its extraordinary technical and interpretive demands, the op. 35 sonata has never been for the faint of heart.</p>

<p>Frédéric Chopin (1810-49) was one of the few composers in history who wrote almost exclusively for a single instrument, the piano, and the vast majority of his works were in single-movement forms. One of only four sonatas by Chopin – three for piano and one for cello – the <i>Piano Sonata No. 2 in B-flat minor, op. 35</i> (<i>Marche funèbre</i>) is an enormously complex and enigmatic work. Its subtitle is taken from the sonata’s third movement, the iconic funeral march that came to exemplify the genre.

Composer and critic Robert Schumann, for example, famously asserted that it didn’t merit the title of sonata as Chopin had simply “bound together four of his most unruly children.” Giving Schumann the benefit of the doubt, this rather harsh assessment may have been influenced by his knowledge that Chopin had in fact composed the third movement two years prior to the rest of the sonata. Later commentators came to the opposite conclusion, identifying melodic and rhythmic motives that seem to bind the four movements quite tightly.</p>

<p>One of the sonata’s unusual features is its reversal in the usual ordering of the two middle movements, which normally would have been a slow second movement followed by a scherzo. In adopting this structure, Chopin may well have been deliberately emulating Beethoven’s <i>Piano Sonata No. 12 in A-flat major, op. 26</i>, which also features a scherzo as the second movement and a funeral march with trio for the third; evidently Chopin’s favorite, he played and assigned to his students more often than any other of Beethoven’s sonatas.</p>

<p>In contrast to his friend Franz Liszt, Chopin did not compose “programmatic” music that sought to depict specific stories or events, but the B-flat minor sonata has often been interpreted in a quasi-programmatic way – and not just because it contains a funeral march. The opening of the first movement itself displays such a ferocious intensity that, as Veda Kaplinsky observes, “it grabs you by the throat and doesn’t let go.” Looking at the arc of the sonata from first to final movement, she sees the first movement as representing the struggle of life; the second as the struggle of death; the third as the actual funeral; and the fourth as hell. (For pianist Anton Rubinstein, one of the most acclaimed interpreters of Chopin’s music, the last movement evoked “winds of night sweeping over churchyard graves.”)</p>

<p>While the first movement of the work is in <a class="glossary" href="glossary.SonataForm2">sonata form</a>, one notable departure from the prototype is that Chopin omitted the first theme from the recapitulation. In an intriguing analysis of the movement, theorist Anatole Leikin extends what he admits is an outmoded literary analogy that describes Classical period sonata forms as a separation and eventual reunification of the forceful first theme “hero” and more lyrical second theme “heroine.” In the B-flat minor sonata, he proposes, “the hero and the heroine cannot be united because the hero dies – and a funeral march ensues.” This is in keeping with a Romantic aesthetic disinclined to happy endings. As Leiken points out, Chopin’s procedure in this movement also contrasts with other of his recapitulations in which the first and second themes remain tonally separated but neither disappears.</p>

<p><z name="video1" align="right" />There is a much-debated question with major implications for the performer regarding the first movement: where should the double bar line indicating the repeat of the exposition occur? The eminent musicologist Charles Rosen believed the repeat should be taken at the very beginning, because the four-bar <a class="glossary" href="glossary.grave">grave</a> passage has “a double function – a dramatic beginning, and a transition from the end of the exposition back to the tonic.” He also argues that the transition makes more sense harmonically this way. Leikin, however, contends that the grave is too dramatic for a literal repetition, and that the deceptive cadence brought about by a repeat at m. 5 brings the listener back to the home key more easily. A third and perfectly valid option, one to which many pianists resort, is simply not to repeat the exposition.</p>


<p>The process of completing the sonata was evidently not easy for Chopin. Recounting his method of composing during the time he was working it, George Sand wrote:</p>

<blockquote>His creation was spontaneous, miraculous. He found ideas without looking for them, without foreseeing them. They came to his piano, sudden, complete, sublime – or sang in his head while he was taking a walk, and he had to hurry and throw himself at the instrument to make himself hear them. But then began a labour more heartbreaking than I have ever seen… He shut himself up in his room for whole days, weeping, walking about, breaking his pens, repeating or altering a measure a hundred times, writing it down and erasing it as often, and starting over the next day with a scrupulous and desperate perseverance. He would spend six weeks on one page, only to return to it and write it just as he had on the first draft …</blockquote>

<p>Chopin also found it difficult to perform. The one time he attempted to play the work for an audience, he had to take a break because of the disturbing “apparitions” he experienced (he had also suffered from nightmarish visions in the past, when he was delirious from illness). It may never have had such an effect on other pianists, but due to its extraordinary technical and interpretive demands, the op. 35 sonata has never been for the faint of heart.</p>

<p>Frédéric Chopin (1810-49) was one of the few composers in history who wrote almost exclusively for a single instrument, the piano, and the vast majority of his works were in single-movement forms. One of only four sonatas by Chopin – three for piano and one for cello – the <i>Piano Sonata No. 2 in B-flat minor, op. 35</i> (<i>Marche funèbre</i>) is an enormously complex and enigmatic work. Its subtitle is taken from the sonata’s third movement, the iconic funeral march that came to exemplify the genre.

Composer and critic Robert Schumann, for example, famously asserted that it didn’t merit the title of sonata as Chopin had simply “bound together four of his most unruly children.” Giving Schumann the benefit of the doubt, this rather harsh assessment may have been influenced by his knowledge that Chopin had in fact composed the third movement two years prior to the rest of the sonata. Later commentators came to the opposite conclusion, identifying melodic and rhythmic motives that seem to bind the four movements quite tightly.</p>

<p>One of the sonata’s unusual features is its reversal in the usual ordering of the two middle movements, which normally would have been a slow second movement followed by a scherzo. In adopting this structure, Chopin may well have been deliberately emulating Beethoven’s <i>Piano Sonata No. 12 in A-flat major, op. 26</i>, which also features a scherzo as the second movement and a funeral march with trio for the third; evidently Chopin’s favorite, he played and assigned to his students more often than any other of Beethoven’s sonatas.</p>

<p>In contrast to his friend Franz Liszt, Chopin did not compose “programmatic” music that sought to depict specific stories or events, but the B-flat minor sonata has often been interpreted in a quasi-programmatic way – and not just because it contains a funeral march. The opening of the first movement itself displays such a ferocious intensity that, as Veda Kaplinsky observes, “it grabs you by the throat and doesn’t let go.” Looking at the arc of the sonata from first to final movement, she sees the first movement as representing the struggle of life; the second as the struggle of death; the third as the actual funeral; and the fourth as hell. (For pianist Anton Rubinstein, one of the most acclaimed interpreters of Chopin’s music, the last movement evoked “winds of night sweeping over churchyard graves.”)</p>

<p>While the first movement of the work is in <a class="glossary" href="glossary.SonataForm2">sonata form</a>, one notable departure from the prototype is that Chopin omitted the first theme from the recapitulation. In an intriguing analysis of the movement, theorist Anatole Leikin extends what he admits is an outmoded literary analogy that describes Classical period sonata forms as a separation and eventual reunification of the forceful first theme “hero” and more lyrical second theme “heroine.” In the B-flat minor sonata, he proposes, “the hero and the heroine cannot be united because the hero dies – and a funeral march ensues.” This is in keeping with a Romantic aesthetic disinclined to happy endings. As Leiken points out, Chopin’s procedure in this movement also contrasts with other of his recapitulations in which the first and second themes remain tonally separated but neither disappears.</p>

<p><z name="video1" align="right" />There is a much-debated question with major implications for the performer regarding the first movement: where should the double bar line indicating the repeat of the exposition occur? The eminent musicologist Charles Rosen believed the repeat should be taken at the very beginning, because the four-bar <a class="glossary" href="glossary.grave">grave</a> passage has “a double function – a dramatic beginning, and a transition from the end of the exposition back to the tonic.” He also argues that the transition makes more sense harmonically this way. Leikin, however, contends that the grave is too dramatic for a literal repetition, and that the deceptive cadence brought about by a repeat at m. 5 brings the listener back to the home key more easily. A third and perfectly valid option, one to which many pianists resort, is simply not to repeat the exposition.</p>


<p>The process of completing the sonata was evidently not easy for Chopin. Recounting his method of composing during the time he was working it, George Sand wrote:</p>

<blockquote>His creation was spontaneous, miraculous. He found ideas without looking for them, without foreseeing them. They came to his piano, sudden, complete, sublime – or sang in his head while he was taking a walk, and he had to hurry and throw himself at the instrument to make himself hear them. But then began a labour more heartbreaking than I have ever seen… He shut himself up in his room for whole days, weeping, walking about, breaking his pens, repeating or altering a measure a hundred times, writing it down and erasing it as often, and starting over the next day with a scrupulous and desperate perseverance. He would spend six weeks on one page, only to return to it and write it just as he had on the first draft …</blockquote>

<p>Chopin also found it difficult to perform. The one time he attempted to play the work for an audience, he had to take a break because of the disturbing “apparitions” he experienced (he had also suffered from nightmarish visions in the past, when he was delirious from illness). It may never have had such an effect on other pianists, but due to its extraordinary technical and interpretive demands, the op. 35 sonata has never been for the faint of heart.</p>

<p>Frédéric Chopin (1810-49) was one of the few composers in history who wrote almost exclusively for a single instrument, the piano, and the vast majority of his works were in single-movement forms. One of only four sonatas by Chopin – three for piano and one for cello – the <i>Piano Sonata No. 2 in B-flat minor, op. 35</i> (<i>Marche funèbre</i>) is an enormously complex and enigmatic work. Its subtitle is taken from the sonata’s third movement, the iconic funeral march that came to exemplify the genre. The sonata was written in summer 1839 when Chopin was staying with his lover <a class="glossary" href="glossary.GeorgeSand">George Sand</a> at her country house in Nohant, France.</p>
